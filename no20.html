Nandivarman III was a powerful monarch who tried to reverse the decline that began in the reign of his father.<br><br>
 He made an alliance with the Rashtrakutas and the Gangas and defeated the Pandyas at the Battle of Tellaru.<br><br>
  He then pursued the retreating Pandyan army as far as the river Vaigai.<br><br>
   The Pandyan king Srimara Srivallabha, however, recovered most of his territories and even defeated the Pallavas at Kumbakonam.<br><br>

Nandivarman had a powerful navy and maintained trade contacts with Siam and Malaya.
