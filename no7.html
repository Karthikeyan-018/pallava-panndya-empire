Pulakeshin II, a deccan king, had previously raided various northern Pallava provinces and forts. <br><br>
However, he was unable to capture the Pallava capital of Kanchipuram.<br><br> This led to a long conflict between the Chalukyas and the Pallavas.<br><br>

Pulakeshin II again attempted to seize the Pallava capital and undertook another expedition several years later. <br><br>However, the Pallava reign had moved on
to Narasimhavarman I by then. <br><br>Narasimhavarman defeated the Chalukyas in several battles, including one at Manimangalam 20 miles to the east of Kanchipuram. <br><br>
The king states that he could see the back of his dreaded enemy as he tore apart his army. <br><br>Encouraged by this victory, Narasimhavarman led his army along
with his general Paranjothi and invaded Vatapi, successfully defeating[4] and killing the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II in 642 CE.<br><br> The city was never a capital again.
