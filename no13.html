Vikramaditya II saw an opportunity in the ensuing civil war in Kanchipuram and espoused the cause of Chitramaya, against that of Nandivarman II.<br><br>
 Vikramaditya II fought many battles with the Pallavas, won three important victories, and occupied Kanchipuram on those occasions.<br><br>
  Around 730, as the Chalukya crown prince, assisted by the Western Ganga Dynasty prince Ereyappa, he attacked the Pallava Paramesvaravarman II.<br><br>
   The Pallava king had to sue for peace at a great financial loss to his kingdom.
