      ahendravarman I was a Pallava king who ruled the Southern portion of present day Andhra region and Northern regions of what forms present-day Tamil Nadu
      in India in the early 7th century. He was a scholar, painter, architect, musician. <br><br>
      He was the son of Simhavishnu, who defeated the Kalabhras and re-established the Pallava kingdom.<br><br>

      During his reign, the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II attacked the Pallava kingdom. <br><br>
      The Pallavas fought a series of wars in the northern Vengi region, before Mahendravarma decimated his chief enemies at Pullalur
       (according to Pallava grants at Kuram, Kasakudi and Tadantottam).<br><br> Although Mahendravarma saved his capital, he lost the northern provinces to Pulakeshin.<br><br>

        Tamil literature flourished under his rule, with the rise in popularity of Tevaram written by Appar and Sambandhar.<br><br>
         Mahendravarman I was the author of the play Mattavilasa Prahasana which is a sanskrit satire and another play called Bhagavadajjuka.<br><br>

      Mahendravarma was succeeded to the throne by his more famous son Narasimhavarman I in 630 CE.<br><br>
       who defeated Pulakeshin II of Chalukya dynasty and ransacked the Chalukyan capital city of Vatapi .<br><br>
