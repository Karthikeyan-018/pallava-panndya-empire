The Pandya victories in Lanka are corroborated by the Mahavamsa.<br><br>

Srimara invaded Sri Lanka during the reign of king Sena I, ravaged northern countries and sacked the city of Anuradhapura.<br><br>
 The king fled from his capital and took refuge in the Malaya country.<br><br>
  Sena was eventually forced to make terms with the Pandyas.
