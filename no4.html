Mahendravarma was initially a patron of the Jainism, but he converted into the Saiva faith under the influence of the Saiva saint Appar.<br><br>
 According to Dhivyacharitam a Sanskrit work on life of Alwars written in 12th century, Yatotkara perumal (mahavishnu), enshrined in Kancheepuram left the city
  along with his great devotee Thirumalisai Alvar, because the Vaishnava Alwar faced tough persecution and exilement from the king who had at least temporarily
  come under the influence of Jainism
