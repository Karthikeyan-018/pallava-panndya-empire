    When Simhavishnu ascended the throne, the Pallava dynasty was beginning to reassert its supremacy.<br><br> His father Simhavarman was an accomplished
     militarist who according to a grant by Rajasimha Pallava (Narasimhavarman II) in the 8th century AD, had destroyed the town and army of Ranarasika,
      a Chalukyan king of the Deccan.    <br><br>

The southern peninsula of India was then ruled by five dynasties.<br><br> The Pallavas, the Cholas and the Pandyas shared the power in Tamil Nadu, Andhra
 Pradesh, parts of southern and eastern Karnataka border and Ceylon; the Cheras controlled Kerala and the Chalukyas controlled Karnataka.<br><br> Simhavishnu,
  who was known for his gallant martial courage and judicial wisdom from a young age, overthrew the Kalabhras and conquered the region up to Kaveri,
   where he came into conflict with the Pandyas and Ceylon.<br><br> He dispatched a naval expedition and occupied Malaya and Sri Lanka and established Kanchipuram as his capital.<br><br>
   The presence of the Pallavas, much before further naval expeditions to Indo-China by their illustrious succeeding and contemporary empires such as the Pandiyans and
    the Cholas, is attested by the existence of specimen of art bearing striking resemblance in countries like Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, as well as scores of inscriptions
     in those lands in the Grantha script (a script in which both Tamil and Sanskrit can be written) in which the Pallavas were the first
    to specialize.<br><br>

Simhavishnu led the revival of the Pallavas, and the period starting with him came to be known as the Greater Pallavas or Later Pallavas dynasty.<br><br>
 The great struggle between the Pallavas and the Chalukyas, which would last for more than two centuries, began during the reign of Simhavishnu.
