Arikesari Maravarman , also known as Parankusa, was a Pandya king of early medieval south India.<br><br>

Arikesari's reign witnessed the beginning of the Pandya contest with the Pallavas in the northern Tamil country.<br><br>
 He probably entered into an alliance with Chalukyas (to the counter the Pallavas).<br><br>
 The Pandyas also came into collision with the Cheras  under his rule.
