Kochchadaiyan, known as Ranadhira, (r. c. 700 – 730 AD) was a Pandya king of early medieval south India.<br><br>
 He was the son and successor of Arikesari Maravarman (r. c. 670 – 700 AD).<br><br>
  The name of the king is famously omitted in the Tamil portion of the Larger Sinnamanur Plates.<br><br>


Chadaiyan extended the Pandya influence into the Kongu country.<br><br>
The result this foray does not appear to have been permanent as the Kongu country is said to have been conquered by his successor also.<br><br>
 He also suppressed a revolt in the Ay country (Trivandrum-Tirunelveli). <br><br>
 The Ay chieftain was defeated in the battle of Marudur (Tiruppudaimarudur, Ambarasamudram) and had to acknowledge the Pandya supremacy.<br><br>
  He is also said to have attacked and defeated the "Maharathas" in the city of Mangalapuram (modern Mangalore).<br><br>

Chadaiyan is given the titles "Vanavan", "Chembiyan" and "Chola" which seem to imply claim to supremacy over the Chera and Chola countries.
