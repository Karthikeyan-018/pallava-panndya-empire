    <div class="Thirupurambiyam">
      Battle of Thirupurambiyam was fought between the Pandya king Varagunavarman II and a confederacy of the Pallavas, Western

       Ganga Dynasty and the Medieval Cholas in about 879 CE near modern-day Kumbakonam.<br><br>
       The Pandyas lost the battle with Varagunavarman II going into retirement.<br><br>

      The battle is considered to be a turning point in the history of South India for it precipitated
      the fall of the Pallava and Pandya kingdoms and triggered the re-emergence of the Chola power in history after centuries of obscurity during Kalabhra rule.
